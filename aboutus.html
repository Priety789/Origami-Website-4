                    Origami is derived from two Japanese words: Ori (folded) and
                    Kami (paper).

                <li>
                    Initially, the art of paper folding was restricted only to ceremonial
                    occasions because paper was scarce and expensive.

                    An ancient Japanese legend says if you fold one thousand cranes you
